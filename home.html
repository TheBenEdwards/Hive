        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hive is part of the Universe account system, which is where one universal account can give you access to so much more than just one use.</p>
        <p>Hive itself is a picture editing tool, that allows the multiple pictures to be editied at once on the same photo. The idea came from when converting old pictues into digital copies, as these would have to be scanned through a scanner. It would become annoying to simply scan single phtotos, so multiple photos were scanned at once. When editing these pictures on a computer, this proved to take much time, so this tool was created to allow this process to be made easy. </p>
        <p>Enjoy!</p>

        <p>Hi! I am Ben Edwards, and I love to work with computers. When i was young I loved working on computers, and started building my own when I was 17. From there, I started learning all sorts of programming languages. Python was my first, and I moved on to html, css, Java, C# Javascript and others. My first large-scale projects were done in Php and SQL, and i look forward to learning and mastering more languages in order to commit to more exciting projects!</p>
